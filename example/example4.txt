Tasks are annotated bash scripts, e.g. `realign.sh`.

The name of a task is equal to its file name without the extension.

Tasks output records.

If task `align` takes inputs `fastq1` and `fastq2` and outputs `bam`.
If task `sort` takes `bam` and outputs `bam` `bai`
We can write a workflow as
```
align |> sort
```
which is syntactic sugar for
```
a = align argv
s = sort { bam = a.bam }
{ bam = s.bam, bai = s.bai }
```
where `argv` is a record of the workflow input. Comparing this two blocks of code, we also note that

- Each task is separated from its input record by a space.
- Records are constructed using `{ }`.
- The first task is automatically given the workflow input `argv`.
- The output of a workflow is just the resulting record on the last line.

Additionally, we can merge records by
```
r & s
```
The record on the right is always right (i.e. it takes precedence when both records have the same attribute).
